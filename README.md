# Mercury
A simple, yet fun discord bot to help bring fun to your guild.

Mercury is a solo project made by pure. It was not created with the vision of gaining profit. All commands are available for free, however upgrading to premium helps Mercury continue running, but is completely optional & only gives command benefits.

## Basics

This is a small overview of Mercury. Full documentation can be found at https://docs.mercurybot.xyz

Mercury's default prefix is `m?`. Mercury also supports slash commands, however not all commands support them.
The prefix can be changed by anyone with `MANAGE_GUILD` permissions by running `m?setprefix <prefix>` or `/setprefix <prefix>`
